# Icon Reloader

## 1.2.0

- A delay before freeze is now enforced in the mod, to ensure that it happens relative to message *receipt*, and that the page has time to refresh before the game stops using updates
- Fix typo in atlas message, and rewrite portions to preserve ordered messages during async page lookups

## 1.1.0

- Supports allocating unused icons to new ids
